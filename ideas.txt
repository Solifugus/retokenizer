BURP -- Variable Consultant 

	The aim of this language is as a minimal iostream processor between
resources.  The minimum base resources of variables and network sockets. 

A program is a variable is a function that receives from an input stream and
outputs to an output stream, as mediated by conditions.  


Overview
	Data streams of visible textual data flow in from and out to external
variables.  These streams contain two types of data: 
	subject data: to be used/modified by operations,
	control data: parameters/results of operations.

	Istream 
		Each moment, Istream is assigned whatever visible text has been 
		received from external entities, and the status of Istream connections.
	Memory
		Any value assigned to memory may thereafter be read unaltered from
		how it was last assigned.
	Ostream
		At the end of each moment, values written to Ostream are sent to 
		relevant external entities and then cleared to defaults.
		

Repetition of Moments:
	(1) Visible text flows in, forming the moment's Input.
	(2) Where output conditions are matched in Input, Internal, and/or Output,
        trigger assignments to Internal and/or Output.
